        Aside from being excellent at connect four and an aspiring geek, I am an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and minoring in Robotics and Mechatronics. My primary goal is to discover things that make me excited, so that I can focus my efforts on positively impacting humanity (on whatever scale!) and enjoying it all the while. I would love to meet like-minded people and forge meaningful personal and professional relationships.

            <li>Present a personal portfolio</li>
            <li>Blog stuff...(?)
              <ol>
                <li>Intro. to engineering (transition for high-schoolers.
                  I'd like to use MathJax for this)
                </li>
                <li>Post and explain summary notes I made for courses
                  (e.g. fluid mechanics)
                </li>
                <li>General life things such as my workflow (coding setup,
